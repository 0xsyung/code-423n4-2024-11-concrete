same issue


[11/16/2024 00:59] dravee
Tried from scratch and didn't get the issue. 
I'll assume you all used the `export NPM_TOKEN=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` command.
What are you all using as OS?
Also, what yarn version? `1.22.22` for me


[11/16/2024 01:12] ribarcheto
i am on WSL, yarn version is the same as yours


[11/16/2024 01:21] poeaudits
Tried exporting it and just hardcoding it in the npmrc, same issue.

use ``npm install``    or if not remove "@blueprint-finance/hub-and-spokes-libraries" line from package.json   and do it again


[11/16/2024 15:22] uaarrr
but there already is a node_modules with this library in the repo as a mitigation, you only need to do that for morpho lib that is also needed in remappings

Yes, it is important to contract not in the scope

what is the purpose of `firstDeposit` variable in `ConcreteMultiStrategyVault.sol` ? I dont see how is that being used


[11/18/2024 23:20] ritik2784
yes there are some `TODOS` as well and there are some functions like this  `function _protocolWithdraw(uint256 assets, uint256 shares) internal virtual {}` types of empty functions in `StrategyBase.sol` should I consider them just normal interaction functions or are there is implementation yet to be done?

[11/25/2024 01:57] berndt_
Blueprints are not directly in scope but there's a couple of functions in the `ClaimRouter` that can only be called by blueprints. There's a comment that says:
```
//this function is only called by the blueprint so we can trust the userBlueprint
```
So I assume that we're trusting them but I don't see this mentioned in the scope.


[11/25/2024 03:02] 0xstalin
If an issue were to say something like, blueprint calls with malicious data, or smth similar, I think that would be out of scope.
But if the call is legit, and, because of some error on the code, the execution does something different, or ends up always reverting or doing smth unexpected, then, chances are something like this may be a legit bug

Can you guys explain the thinking behind the Swapper? I.e. what economic incentives do you want to create. If that's in the docs I couldn't find it


[11/28/2024 06:40] superman_i4g
Read the doc carefully. I think it‚Äôs there.


[11/28/2024 07:30] 0xstalin
so, my understanding is that users get a better market rate by swapping their shares of X ConcreteVault for a rewardToken. Instead of withdrawing from the vault, they can get a better rate by swapping their shares for a rewardToken, and the vault's shares swapped by the user are sent to the Treasury. 
So, for users, opt to swap instead of withdrawing from the vault.
For the protocol: attracts liquidity to the vaults (because first and foremost, to swap is required to have shares of a vault), and it mitigates withdrawals from the vaults, the already deposited assets are left on the strategies generating yield.

[11/28/2024 22:20] 0xstalin
I don't think there is a minimum number of strategies, I've coded PoCs using 1 and 2 strategies. The only restriction I'm aware of is that each vault can have at most 1 ProtectStrategy.

Hi,
Previously i submitted findings on Kleidi (It was public) and Rameses Exchange.
But previously whenever i went to code4rena's findings section and under Past findings I could not find my submissions.

But now I participated on Concrete contest and under the Past findings I can see my submissions on Concrete.

Can anyone explain me why currently i can see my findings for the Concrete contest which finished last day. But when I was trying to see contest of Kleidi and Rameses Exchange I could not.

Kleidy and Ramses results were published on GH, Concrete results are on the c4 app.
On GH you needed the SR/backstage role, maybe on the c4 app that is not a requirement anymore

Hey!

If I don't have the backstage role, I can not see the findings, yet, right?


[12/01/2024 14:13] donkicha
I mean all of the submitted findings.

Hi @thebrittfactor | C4 - Away , had a question regarding this PJQA rule, if you could kindly clarify:
`QA and Gas reports marked as unsatisfactory by the Validators are NOT eligible.`

It does not apply to a report like this for example (attached), does it? Was raised as `Med`  and then downgraded to `Low` in Triage phase.
I do not really plan to raise any query under it during the PJQA phase but am curious to understand that in case I found that it was incorrectly invalidated in both the Triage and Judge phases, I can still add a comment for the judge to have a look?

even if you have findingds c4 hasn't opened verification in so long so you'll still have to wait


[01/23/2025 20:42] zxriptor
I do have backstage, still can't understand what is going on there, UX sucks. How do you distinguish resolved from pending escalations?


[01/23/2025 21:18] 0xstalin
Based on the judge's reply.
You can easily tell if the decision is final or if there is room to clarify something.


[01/23/2025 21:19] 0xstalin
And if there is no reply yet, then, that of course is still pending

üëèüèª ü´° kudos to the judge @Picodes for maintaining their composure & politeness throughout the gruelling judging session. We as wardens surely can have feedback & expectations on speeding up the process, but honestly judging such volume of submissions and PJQA is no mean task. Whether I agree or disagree with the judgements, the fact that he maintained a high degree of professionalism is extremely commendable. 
Politeness matters üôèüèª

What will happen if the rewards are sent before my tax info be approved?

As long as you have submitted your tax information, you should be fine.
