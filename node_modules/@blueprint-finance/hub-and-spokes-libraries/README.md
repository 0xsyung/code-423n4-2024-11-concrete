# Concrete Hub-and-Spokes Libraries Repository

## Overview

Concrete is an interchain protocol that protects collateralized positions from liquidation risk while allowing liquidity providers to earn an above-market, risk-adjusted return on their deposits. The protocol follows a modular hub-and-spoke architecture, allowing flexible, composable development.

This repository contains the shared libraries that are used across the hub and spokes repositories. The modular approach enables seamless integration and scaling by allowing new libraries to be added without affecting the core hub or spokes repositories.

The repo contains essential libraries, interfaces, and utility contracts used within the Concrete protocol. The repository uses Foundry as its primary development framework.

## Getting Started

We use Foundry for building, testing, and scripting. Please follow the instructions to install Foundry from the [official site](https://getfoundry.sh/).

To start, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hub-and-spokes-libraries.git
cd hub-and-spokes-libraries
```

### Prerequisites

- **Foundry**: Install from the [Foundry official site](https://getfoundry.sh/).
- **Node.js** (optional, for certain scripts).

## Overview of the Repository

The structure of the repository is as follows:

- **./lib**: Contains external libraries used within the protocol. (Will be created when running `forge install`)
- **./src/interfaces**: Interfaces for the protocol, enabling modular and extensible contract architecture.
- **./src/libraries**: Core Solidity libraries that provide reusable logic across the hub and spokes contracts.
- **./src/utils**: Utility contracts and helper libraries that assist in various operations.
- **./test**: Test files to ensure the correctness of the libraries.

The modular nature of this repository allows developers to easily add or update libraries without modifying the hub or spokes repositories directly.

## Usage Instructions

### Building the Contracts
To build the contracts, use Foundry:
```
yarn run forge:build
```

### Running Tests
To run all tests:
```
yarn run forge:test
```

## Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines:

1. Review the [Testing Guidelines](./test/Readme.md) before contributing.
2. Ensure that your code is modular and follows our architecture principles.
3. Create a Pull Request (PR) for any changes and request at least one reviewer.
4. Run all tests and ensure they pass before submitting a PR.

Target all PRs to the `develop` branch, which is the active development branch.

## Audit Report

Please refer to our audit report in the `./audit` directory for a detailed security review of the protocol's libraries.
